# if it has any test to run in the folder structure, it will test with the above command

# every folder should have a single test_.py file to run specific tests

# every test file should begin with test_ or finish with _test

# To test a single function in a file, we need to write the file path, two colons and the function name
- pytest test_shopping_cart.py::test_can_get_total_price

# To show the function prints, we also write "-s" in the end of the line
- pytest test_shopping_cart.py::test_can_get_total_price -s
